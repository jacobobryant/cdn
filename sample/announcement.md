I put together [a little spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVQC7WznrQ8MNaRrmbfIDbutvnjbKGaB_rtXcXmFjFc/edit#gid=0) of cross-promotion performance last week as an aid for pitching more people on sharing referral links. There's been an uptick in people doing that recently, by the way&mdash;thank you!

I've also sort-of finished a draft of a blog post: [How The Sample has driven 10K newsletter subscriptions](https://gist.github.com/jacobobryant/27cd9bf808654c2dddb411f8df5d3a8f). I was planning to publish it tomorrow, but I still need to generate some charts, so I'll publish it next week. In the mean time, give it a read and let me know if you think there's anything else I should talk about. I'll probably send this email out Tuesday morning next week so I can throw in a link to the tweet announcement.

I've been thinking about how to improve our retention. We get new subscribers every day, but they're pretty much matched by our unsubscribers, and we remain on a plateau. Improving the recommendation algorithm is one important thing obviously, and we continue to do that. I think setting expectations correctly up front is also important, and after the latest round of landing page tweaks, I'm satisfied with our handling of that. Besides those things, I think it'd be helpful to have a closer relationship with subscribers somehow.

These weekly emails hopefully do that for publishers, but I haven't interacted with everyone else very much apart from answering emails. I'm not much of a tweeter, but maybe
it'd help to write a short weekly thread about what we've been working on and throw in a link to it in the emails, perhaps every Tuesday. Kind of like a mini version of these weekly announcements but oriented towards regular subscribers.

In other news, I spent a fair amount of time last week applying metaphorical duct tape to our production servers. We're strict adherents of the [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/) architectural pattern. It's about time for another code overhaul&mdash;hopefully I'll start on that late this week.
