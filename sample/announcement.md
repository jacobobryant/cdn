I've updated the publisher console. Now it includes some charts (also in this email) so you can see what results you're getting from The Sample
over time. It also breaks down the stats by forward type: organic, cross-promotion, and paid. So now you can see exactly how many subscribers you've received as a
result of sharing the cross-promotion link (I've started calling it this instead of the "referral link").

Speaking of which, I made some adjustments to how the algorithm distributes cross-promotion forwards. Both before and now, we
look at the percentage of referrals that have come via your link and compare that to the percentage of cross-promotion forwards
you've received (10% of the emails we send are dedicated to cross-promotion, similar to how 10% are dedicated to paid forwards).
We try to keep the percentages equal. So if you share the link and refer a bunch of people, you'll continue getting cross-promotion forwards
until the equilibrium is restored.

So, about the change: previously we did some "wealth redistribution." Even if you hadn't shared the referral link at all, we still gave
you a few cross-promotion forwards anyway. I did this mainly because I wanted to ensure that new newsletters always got at least a few forwards
after they were submitted. However, because the vast majority of newsletters don't refer anyone, this meant that (1) people who did share the link
were getting about 30% fewer forwards than they otherwise would've, and (2) people who didn't share the link still didn't get enough forwards from
it to make much of a difference.

So I've nixed the redistribution thing. With these changes, each subscriber you refer translates to about 78 cross-promotion forwards. So e.g. if you've referred
5 people, you will eventually receive 340 cross-promotion forwards. I can't guarantee how *quickly* you'll receive those forwards, but if the number
of cross-promotion 1-click subscribes you've received is less than the number of subscribers you've referred, then we put you first in line so to speak.
From what I've noticed, it looks like most people get "paid back" within 2 or 3 weeks.

I'm not sure if we still have a problem with new newsletters not getting any forwards for a while--but we may take a closer look at this soon.
