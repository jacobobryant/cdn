This week's publisher report is a day later than usual because I've been [quite busy](https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/), but better late than never.

I have a [half-finished blog post](https://gist.github.com/jacobobryant/f49ad5e38c609005a4b89266ffe6dbad) that I was planning to publish this morning. However after a conversation yesterday with Jordan who writes [The Mental Health Update](https://newsletter.thementalhealthupdate.com/), I've decided to de-prioritize blogging. Instead of publishing something once per week, I'll just publish whenever
I have something really worth writing, without trying to stick to a schedule. At the moment I have one such blog post idea, which I mentioned last week: within the next two days,
we'll hit the milestone of 10,000 subscribers referred to other newsletters (via the subscribe-in-1-click links), and I think that'll make for a noteworthy post.

However before I worry about that, I'm going to start focusing on cross promotion again. But instead of a spray-and-pray approach, I'm going to be more focused. I'd
like to find newsletters with 2k - 10k subscribers, ideally curated/list-of-links newsletters (so a link to The Sample would fit in). If you know anyone who you think would
be interested in cross promoting with The Sample, let me know.

Speaking of which, as part of that, I'm still planning to update the publisher report so it's more clear how many forwards/subscribers you're getting on a weekly basis. Especially
I'd like to make it easy to see the results you get after sharing a referral link, since it's not super easy to see now. Maybe I'll have it also say something like "after referring X
subscribers to The Sample, you've received Y additional subscribers."

And then back to optimizing the algorithm...
