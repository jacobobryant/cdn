Last week I mentioned I was going to start blogging weekly. I didn't manage to finish a post in time for tomorrow morning,
but I at least have a title: "Curating the curators." Manual curation tends to have high quality but it's hard to scale, whereas
algorithmic recommendations are easy to scale but tend to not be very good. An interesting thing about The Sample is that
it's kind of a mix: it provides algorithmic recommendations for newsletters, but many of those newsletters in turn include manually curated
links/recommendations. Instead of trying to recommend individual articles, or books, or music, etc, The Sample tries to help you find other people who curate
those things to your taste. Another thought for a title I had was "last-mile curation." Algorithmic recommendation is like a train or a bus
system. It can get you in the general vicinity of where you want to go, and then human curators (the scooters in this analogy) can take you the rest
of the way.

(If that sounds at all interesting, you might also enjoy Benedict Evans' pieces [Search, discovery and marketing](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/6/24/search-discovery-and-marketing) and [The death of the newsfeed](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed))

Anyway, I'm planning to write this post tomorrow and then publish it Wednesday morning. Once it's up, you can share this
URL on Twitter etc. if you so desire: [https://thesample.ai/blog/curating-the-curators/?ref={{ nl.nl/ref-code }}](https://thesample.ai/blog/curating-the-curators/?ref={{ nl.nl/ref-code }}). Note that the URL includes your unique referral code. Anyone who signs up for The Sample after
clicking your link will count towards your referrals (and will thus boost the number of times we forward your newsletter).

Alternatively you can follow [@the_sample_umm](https://twitter.com/the_sample_umm) and then retweet after I post the link there. That'll probably
help more, though of course the link wouldn't have your referral code then. Either way I'll be grateful.

Last week when I asked for blog post topics someone mentioned serialized fiction. I'll be adding some relevant sources for that to my RSS reader,
and I'll see if I can think of anything interesting to say. If you have any other ideas for things you'd like to hear me write
about, let me know. Regardless I'll probably write the next few pieces about whatever is most interesting to me personally, but I'd like to
shift gradually towards writing things that are interesting to all (or at least many) of you.
