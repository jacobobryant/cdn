We've had 47 more people submit their newsletters in the past week. Welcome everyone!

The [blog post](https://thesample.ai/blog/10k-subscriptions/) from last week seems to have gone over pretty well. I'm extremely grateful to all of you who shared it. Besides all the newsletter submissions, we've had a few hundred new signups, enough that growth has been even higher than churn (7-day moving average for daily active users hit 1,825 today, up from 1,761 a week ago). We're averaging 39 signups per day (today we had 58!). I'm interested to see how growth is over the next few weeks, after the spike has subsided.

I did a tiny bit more retention analysis on our July cohort (the one where we had a huge signup spike from getting featured in Recomendo), which has been our highest-retaining cohort. It looks like retention has actually flattened out for them pretty nicely:

(That dip on day 4 was because we had a technical glitch and didn't send out the emails until the afternoon one day).

That being said, that cohort hasn't flattened in terms of 1-click subscribes:

I'm interested to see if that second chart flattens out over the next few months. Even if retention isn't good enough for us to grow organically, we might still be able to grow profitably via cross-promotion and/or paid acquisition. In total, we've had about 6,000 signups (including people who have since unsubscribed) and we've generated about 12,000 one-click subscribes&mdash;so on average, each incoming subscriber results in two outgoing subscriptions. Thus, for example, we could crank up the portion of forwards dedicated to cross-promotion to 50%, and that should allow us to match the number of subscribers we receive in cross-promotions *no matter how many people cross-promote with us*.

Similarly, if we do paid acquisition, we can crank up the portion of paid forwards those people get. If we set paid forwards to 50% and we make as much money from a paid 1-click subscribe as we spend to get a subscriber, we'd break even. That seems doable! (We are in fact experimenting with Facebook ads&mdash;our CPA is currently at $1.25 which seems kind of shocking, a lot better than the $4 CPA we were getting a while ago, though I don't think we've had any 1-click subscribes from these people yet).
