 - I chatted with Dominik from Refind last week, and it turns out they have an automated [cross-promotion setup](https://refind.com/cross-promo) kind of like The Sample's. Worth checking out! It's worked great for me already.

 - I accidentally broke the subscribers CSV export over the weekend. If you tried to export subscribers in the past few days and it didn't work, try again now.

 - Speaking of which, if you're on Substack, you should still export/import your subscribers occassionally because Substack sometimes requires new subscribers to click a confirmation link even if you don't have double opt-in enabled. I've added a note about this to the publisher console.

I've finished all the code maintenance stuff I've been working on. I was going to implement a few more user-facing features, but now that the time has come, they don't feel essential enough. So I've made a [roadmap/backlog document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6db1c8SUPa2a6wrjwn8fs53cN9CcadmRjO3E5ubvds/edit?usp=sharing) for anyone who's interested in the list of things I'm planning to do eventually, and in the mean time, I'm making user acquisition my primary focus.

If all goes well, I would love to stay focused on growth until we're making enough money that I can hire a freelancer to continue adding incremental features. If not, perhaps at some point I'll start devoting one day per week to it with the rest of my time spent on growth. Either way my cofounder will continue to work on the recommendation algorithm which is the main part of the product we need to keep improving.

By the way, I wrote a little blog post which some of you may find interesting: [The messy future of social media](https://jacobobryant.com/p/messy-future-social-media/).
