I finally finished writing this blog post: [How The Sample drives thousands of newsletter subscriptions](https://thesample.ai/blog/10k-subscriptions/). (Obviously "thousands" is cumulative&mdash;turns out the median number of subscribers that individual newsletters get, excluding paid and cross-promotion subscribers, is seven). If you'd like to do us "a solid" as they say, you can retweet [the announcement](#).

With that out of the way, I'm now refactoring our server code which has been devolving into a ball of mud. Soon it will be sculpted into a beautiful castle made of clay, hopefully to hold its shape for at least three or four months. As I mentioned last week, we'll also be doing some more churn/retention analysis, looking for things to optimize. Our monthly churn is roughly 8% which feels... not great?

I'm a little anxious about how good our retention can be&mdash;will we get a significant percentage of people to stay active for a long time? Or will this be a thing where people subscribe for a while, find a handful of newsletters they like, and then leave? I guess even if it is the latter, that doesn't necessarily mean The Sample won't be a successful business; we just need to be aware of that and respond accordingly. Though as a backup plan, maybe I should spend a little more time working on complementary products to integrate with The Sample. I've got ideas both on the publishing and reading side for things I'd like to use myself, but I haven't prioritized them since I have only so many hours in a day (especially with a 10-month old daughter!) and need to stay focused.
