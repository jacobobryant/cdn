**The referral program**

As I mentioned last week, I went through the newsletters in our database with high conversion rates and emailed the publishers, asking
if they'd like to cross-promote with The Sample (to the handful of you who joined after getting one of these emails, welcome!).
However, to my slight dismay, I don't think that directly pitching people on cross-promotion will be enough by itself to sustain growth.
I ended up going through most of the newsletters in the database faster than I expected (I was being fairly-but-not-extremely selective).

Previously I was thinking that I could import lots of newsletters, wait for them to accumulate some 1-click subscribes, then email the publishers
like I did this week (saying basically "we've got you X new subscribers, want to cross promote so you can get more?"). However now I think a better
idea is to send publishers a quick notification email as soon as I import their newsletter, something like "Hi I run this thing called The Sample, it helps
people get more newsletter subscribers, I just added your newsletter, if you want to see statistics and stuff
you can click this link to create a publisher account, also if you want to opt-out you can click this link and then we won't forward your newsletter."

With that approach, I'd be comfortable being less selective with who I email while still maintaining an acceptable
level of non-spamminess. I still wouldn't send the message to e.g. large media outlets, but I also wouldn't need to exclude
people simply because I don't think they'd be interested in cross promotion. Some of the people who make publisher accounts will see the
referral link after they sign in, but even those who don't make an account will at least know we exist
and hopefully have a favorable impression.

So after I get an email template set up for that, I'll start importing more newsletters daily. If the positive response rate is high enough, I could ramp that up and spend all day importing newsletters (fingers crossed). Fortunately I have a big back log of newsletters to import
thanks to the "what other newsletters do you subscribe to" question in our signup flow.

**Blogging**

- here's a list that's more spaced out

- here's the second item in the list

Besides all that, I've decided it's time to finally bite the bullet and start writing regularly again instead of trying to rely on just growth
hacks. I've spent [a bit](https://jacobobryant.com/directory/) of time writing in the past with meh results, but now that I don't need to spend much time coding, I'm willing to put more time and persistence into writing&mdash;even if it takes a long time to pay off.

Probably starting next Monday, I'm planning to write one piece per week. I'll include a link in these emails so you can share it if you like.
I'm going to make it work with the referral program too: the link in this email will include your newsletter's unique referral code. If you
share an article I write and people sign up for The Sample after following your link, it'll count towards your referrals.

As such, I am very curious to know what things you'd be interested to read. Most things related to newsletters would be on-topic,
especially newsletter discoverability. But also, newsletters are just one part of the broader "information ecosystem," and that's
what I'm fundamentally focused on.

Here are a few examples of things I've written previously. I will probably update some of these and repost them on The Sample's website
in addition to writing new articles.
